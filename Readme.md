# Thermal Imaging Workshop

## When

-   November 11, 2022

## Where

-   Lund University, Department of Biology

## Instructors

-   Dr. Dominic McCafferty
-   Dr. Andreas Nord
-   Dr. Joshua Tabh
-   Dr. Glenn Tattersall

## Schedule

### Morning Session (0900h Lecture/Seminar)

-   0900h-1000h: Theory and Background to Infrared Thermal Imaging
-   1000h-1200h: Break out groups using one of the 5 cameras - familiarity with cameras. Practical Field Sessions using thermal cameras (5 to use).  Groups pursue questions ranging from: Ambient Temperature Effects, Distance Effects, Insulation Effects, Blurring Effects, Movement Effects, Curvature/Angle Effects - using self subjects.

## Lunch Break (1200 - 1300)

### Afternoon Session (1300 - 1600h)

-   1300h-1330h - Demonstrate analytical aspects of software analysis, analysing thermal images and videos, common pitfalls in analysis and image capture.

-   1330h-1500h: Analyse group data collected in the morning and present to groups your findings. 

-   1500h-1530h Automation challenges in Thermal Imaging 
    
-   1530h-1600h: Wrap-pp session, question period.

-   Aim to finish by 1600h.
    

## Before you attend

-   To participate in this workshop, you will need access to a laptop (preferrably PC, but there may be Mac software available) with functioning software solution for examining FLIR radiometric image files. 

- A 30 day trial of FLIR Research Studio may be the best option:

Website](img/FLIR_Research_Studio_Download.png)

- It can be downloaded for PC, Mac, and Linux here: https://www.flir.co.uk/discover/rd-science/experience-flir-research-studio/

-  Alternatively, a free version of FLIR Studio Starter can be downloaded here (only for PC): https://www.flir.co.uk/instruments/thermal-studio-plan-selection/ but choose the free option that gives us limited access to features:

-   This version is free, although you do need to "sign up" with FLIR to
    have access.

-   Register with FLIR and they will send you a license key to access
    the free software features.

-   See below for a quick intro to the software features:

Alternative FLIR software downloads: - FLIR Studio Starter link if the
above does not work:

-   FLIR Tools + (older version that may work better on some systems,
    but the Mac version is no longer available because FLIR hardly
    supports Mac OSX). Note: this software is likely to be discontinued.

## File Access

-   During the afternoon workshop we will demonstrate functionality of
    analysing radiometric images by using previously collected thermal
    images and thermal videos.

-   Please verify you can access files from the following onedrive
    website:
