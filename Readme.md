-   Field Thermography

### Afternoon Session (Break-out groups of 10)

-   Practical Field Session using thermal cameras

-   Practical Lab Session using thermal imaging software, analysing
    thermal images and videos, common pitfalls in analysis and image
    capture.

## Before you attend

-   To participate in this workshop, you will need access to a PC laptop
    with functioning software solution for examining FLIR radiometric
    image files. (Mac options are not available from FLIR,
    unfortunately).

- A 30 day trial of FLIR Research Studio is the best option:
![FLIR Research Studio Download from Teledyne Flir
Website](img/FLIR_Research_Studio_Download.png) and can be downloaded for PC, Mac, and Linux here:

https://www.flir.co.uk/discover/rd-science/experience-flir-research-studio/

-  Alternatively, a free versionf FLIR Studio Starter can be downloaded here: https://www.flir.co.uk/instruments/thermal-studio-plan-selection/ but choose the free option that gives us limited access to features:

-   This version is free, although you do need to "sign up" with FLIR to
    have access.

-   Register with FLIR and they will send you a license key to access
    the free software features.

Alternative FLIR software downloads: - FLIR Studio Starter link if the
above does not work:

-   FLIR Tools + (older version that may work better on some systems,
    but the Mac version is no longer available because FLIR hardly
    supports Mac OSX). Note: this software is likely to be discontinued.

## File Access

-   During the afternoon workshop we will demonstrate functionality of
    analysing radiometric images by using previously collected thermal
    images and thermal videos.

-   Please verify you can access files from the following onedrive
